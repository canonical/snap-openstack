# Baremetal service

This feature provides Baremetal service for Sunbeam. It's based on [Ironic](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic/latest/), the bare metal provisioning service for OpenStack.

## Installation

To enable the Baremetal service, you need an already bootstraped Sunbeam instance, and the storage role enabled. Then, you can install the feature with:

```bash
sunbeam enable baremetal
```
