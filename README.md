## What is OpenStack?

OpenStack is a collection of open source projects designed to work together to
form the basis of a cloud. It enables organizations to transform their data
centers into modern and robust platforms that resemble the behavior of leading
public clouds, while empowering them to keep full control over their budget and
sovereignty.

## What is Sunbeam?

Sunbeam lowers the barrier to entry for OpenStack and simplifies its deployment
and operations processes. Backed by cloud-native architecture, Sunbeam uses
bottom-up automation and high-level abstraction to make OpenStack accessible to
newcomers and help users get to grips with the platform immediately.

## What is Canonical OpenStack?

Canonical OpenStack (based on Sunbeam) is an enterprise cloud solution that
distills the maturity and comprehensiveness of the upstream OpenStack project
into an award-winning product. Canonical OpenStack gives organizations access
to a broad range of commercial services: from design and delivery to
post-deployment operations and maintenance.
